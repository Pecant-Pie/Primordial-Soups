Randomly generated structures for primordial crocks and precipitation basins. 
Unique recipes for making ore soup using liquids, raw ores, and natural and unnatural ingredients in the crocks. 
Special ingredients for increasing the soup yield or decreasing the cook time.
Integration with mods to add crocks for certain non-renewable minerals, and new special ingredients.
Also, the crocks and basins can't be picked up and moved, so you'll need to get creative in order to automate this process.
